# WHAT IS THIS REPO?

Chromebook777 Productions is a discord server with a dedicated team of staff and
(somewhat) active members. We are making a discord bot so we decided we needed a
website

# WEBSITE BUILD STATUS:

![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/chromebot-websites/chromebot.cf/Deploy%20react%20app%20to%20github?logo=github)<br/>
![CodeFactor Grade](https://img.shields.io/codefactor/grade/github/chromebot-websites/chromebot.cf?logo=codefactor&logoColor=white)<br/>

If the build is passing that means that the latest and greatest is on
https://chromebot.cf, if not then maybe try fixing and create a pull request (or
just commit directly to the master branch (pontentially unsafe) - don't worry,
the site won't break; it just won't have the latest commits.

## Coding languages used:
