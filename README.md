# WHAT IS THIS REPO?
Chromebook777 Productions is a discord server with a dedicated team of staff and (somewhat) active members. We are making a discord bot so we decided we needed a website

# WEBSITE BUILD STATUS:
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/chromebot-websites/beta.chromebot.cf.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/chromebot-websites/beta.chromebot.cf) [![DepShield Badge](https://depshield.sonatype.org/badges/chromebot-websites/beta.chromebot.cf/depshield.svg)](https://depshield.github.io)

If the build is passing that means that the latest and greatest is on https://chromebot.cf, if not then maybe try fixing and create a pull request (or just commit directly to the master branch (pontentially unsafe) - don't worry, the site won't break; it just won't have the latest commits.
